# CS546-Final-Project

Welcome to our project repository! To ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, please adhere to the following guidelines:

Task Selection and Tracking

    Choose a Task: Refer to our Project Tasks Spreadsheet to select a task. Feel free to add new tasks.
    Task ID: Assign a unique ID to your task and update this in the spreadsheet to avoid overlaps.

Code Organization

    Common Helper Functions: Use functions from the common helper file for shared functionalities (e.g., checkString).
    Specific Helper Functions: If you develop unique helper functions for your task, place them in a separate file within the helper folder.

Repository Management

    Feature Branches: Do not push changes directly to the main branch. Create a feature branch for your work and submit changes via pull requests.
    Pull Requests: Ensure that your code is reviewed through pull requests before merging into the main branch.
